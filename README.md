*DESCRIPTION*: In this task, I built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques on an anime dataset. The goal was to design a system that could recommend anime shows to users based on their preferences and ratings. Recommendation systems are widely used in various domains, including entertainment, e-commerce, and social media, to help users discover new items or content based on their past behaviors or the preferences of similar users. For this task, I used the Anime Recommendation Database, which contains ratings given by users to various anime titles, along with user demographic information. The first step in building the recommendation system was to load and preprocess the dataset. The dataset included ratings from users for different anime shows, which were provided on a scale of 1 to 10. I began by handling missing data, as some users may not have rated all anime titles. In this case, I used an implicit feedback approach for missing values by assuming that users who did not rate certain anime shows likely did not watch them. The dataset was then divided into training and testing sets, ensuring that the testing set represented a reasonable portion of the total data to evaluate the model’s effectiveness on unseen data. Next, I employed collaborative filtering to build the recommendation system. Collaborative filtering is a popular method that makes recommendations based on past behaviors, such as ratings or interactions, and assumes that users who have agreed in the past will continue to agree in the future. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based. For this task, I used matrix factorization, which is a specific form of collaborative filtering that decomposes the large user-item interaction matrix into two smaller matrices, one representing users and the other representing items (anime shows). This technique allows the model to capture latent features that explain the observed ratings. I used the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method, a well-known matrix factorization technique, to factorize the user-item matrix and discover hidden patterns between users and anime shows. SVD decomposes the original matrix into three matrices: one representing user features, another representing item features, and a diagonal matrix containing singular values that indicate the importance of the corresponding features. After applying matrix factorization through SVD, I predicted the ratings for anime shows that a user has not yet rated by reconstructing the user-item matrix. The predicted ratings helped determine which anime a user might like based on similar users' preferences. I then implemented a recommendation function that suggested the top anime shows for each user, based on the predicted ratings. To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system, I used various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which measure the difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in the test set. These metrics helped assess the accuracy of the model’s recommendations. Additionally, I performed cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and prevent overfitting by testing it on different subsets of the dataset. Finally, I fine-tuned the model by adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of latent factors in the matrix factorization and the regularization terms to improve the model’s accuracy and prevent overfitting. By analyzing the results, I found that the collaborative filtering approach, combined with matrix factorization, was effective in making personalized anime recommendations based on users' historical ratings.In conclusion, this task involved building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques on an anime dataset. By employing SVD for matrix factorization, I was able to recommend anime shows to users based on latent features and historical ratings. The evaluation metrics demonstrated that the system could make accurate predictions, helping users discover anime titles they were likely to enjoy. This task provided a valuable learning experience in implementing recommendation algorithms and applying matrix factorization techniques to real-world data.
